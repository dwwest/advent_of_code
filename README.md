Christmas, Christmas time is near,
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast,
Want a plane that loops the loop
Me, I want a hula hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late.
That was very good, Simon.
(Naturally.)
Very good Theodore.
(Giggles)
Uh, Alvin, you were a little flat, watch it.
Uh, Alvin.
Alvin.
ALVIN!
(Okay!)
Want a plane that loops the loop
I still want a hula hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late.
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late.
